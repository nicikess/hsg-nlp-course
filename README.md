# Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning

## Description
This repository contains notebooks and other code snippets from the NLP course which I took during my masters at HSG. This repository is not complete an give only an overview over this things covered in the course. The course focuses on providing a comprehensive understanding of the technology behind state-of-the-art language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. As a participant, you learn about the fundamental concepts and techniques in NLP and deep learning and explore their various applications.

## Key Learnings
Throughout this course, I gained knowledge and skills in the following areas:

1. **Text Processing**: Learn the basics of text processing, including techniques for cleaning and preprocessing textual data.

2. **Advanced Techniques**: Explore advanced NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis, text summarization, and text classification. Understand how these techniques can be applied to analyze and understand textual data.

3. **NLP Model Applications**: Discover how NLP models can be utilized for various tasks, including building chatbots, information extraction, and machine translation. Gain insights into the practical applications of NLP models in solving real-world problems.

4. **End-to-End Neural Models**: Explore the advancements in NLP achieved by end-to-end neural models, such as GPT-3. Learn how these models eliminate the need for task-specific feature engineering and significantly enhance the performance of NLP tasks.

5. **Comprehensive Knowledge**: Through lectures, inverse teaching methods, and a final project, develop a comprehensive understanding of modern NLP techniques and gain the ability to apply these concepts effectively to solve real-world problems.

## Getting Started
